                <p>I am a Graphic Designer originally from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I love doing all things creative and using my time to gain design experience and become even more passionate about using my creativity as tool to forge a brighter future. My work consists of publication design, digital graphics, branding, industrial design and other experiments. I have a strong fascination with color, shapes, textures and typography. I aspire to bring different cultural perspectives when it come creating work. Outside of the design world I am apart of the Florida Army National Guard where I serve as a 42A, Human Resource Specialist for the past two years. Through past positions I have become well accustomed and proficient at managing a broad spectrum of both print and digital design projects that stick to established brand guidelines and aesthetics. With my drive and creative problem solving skills I have been able to cultivate innovative works within set standards.
                </p>
                <p>I am currently pursing a higher education at the Univesity of Florida, where I hope to recieve a Master of Art in Web Design. I previously attended Louisiana State University School of Art and concentrated in Graphic Design.</p>
